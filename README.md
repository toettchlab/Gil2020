# Gil2020
Code to fit parameters from bio-layer interferometry, from Gil et al 2020

There are three kinds of files in this repository:
1  - CODE (files with extension .m): this is the set of 4 MATLAB functions and 1 script to load and analyze bio-layer interferometry (BLI) data.
2  - SAVED ANALYSES (files with extension .mat): this is the output of the code as applied to all of the BLI data in Gil et al, Nat Comms 2020.
3  - RAW DATA (files with extension .txt, bundled into data_files.zip): this is the raw BLI data from Gil et al, Nat Comms 2020.

To run, download all .m files and data_files.zip, unzip the data files into a folder called data_files\, and run script_bli_fitting.m. 

If anything seems weird, just check whether your output is the same as in the corresponding .mat file from our saved analyses.

Happy fitting & analysis!
